# Drafting with Signed Distance Functions
This work is being presented as a poster at SIGGRAPH 2020 under the title "A CAD Interface for Drafting with Signed Distance Functions." This application implements a simple interface for drawing shapes that are rendered by signed distance functions. The goal is to develop a collaborative, offline-first parametric drafting application for architects and designers.
