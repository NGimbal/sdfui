# What problem does Fluent Solve?
Fluent is a collaborative drafting app built to streamline design communication.

# What's the story?
Designing, engineering and building buildings is increasingly a collaborative effort that requires coordination of details between multiple offices across large distances. This has been caused by increasing regulatory and technological complexities that have required professionals to specialize and collaborate with other specialists. Today the bulk of this coordination is done through PDFâ€™s that are edited and emailed back and forth between offices. Lamina will increase the productivity of this collaboration.
